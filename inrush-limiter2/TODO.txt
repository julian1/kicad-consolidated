as a DUT device a simpler approach
  - three way switch. off, ntc resistor, on
  - and fuse it.

-----
for standalone project
  - having transformer is good. not an issue if large.
  - eg. cap dropper is smaller, but doesn't matter if stand-alone.

if integrated into project, then might use micro to turn on (ntc protects against non turn on).
  use power from either,
  - a separate 5v winding, to power relay and optocoupler.
  - or main 5v board voltage to relay.

the problem of cap-dropper is that it's 5v differential. not 5 volt with respect to earth.

the NTC solves the problem of the relay failing to close

buy a centre punch - from model shop?

fix/investigate - invert regulator diodes which were incorrect?
change filter cap value.

TODO

- mounting holes.
- kickback protection diode for the coil relay.
- space around fuse to make it easier to access/change
- increase clearance between mov and fuse 
- cap for zener reference to stabilize ripple.
- larger space for filter cap - maybe no because 16V 2200uF is small footprint 
- maybe more heat dissipation space for ntc 
- don't require discharge resistor across cap - because its low voltage
- is a large filter cap a problem? it means we potentially continue to have power, even after interruption to power 
- have an opto-coupler alternative to short the relay (use a jumper to select opto or timer).

- done - check the timing cap will fit. (it's too close to the pot)
- done - fix transformer footprint
- done - fix terminal block footprint
- done - fix 1m trim pot
- done - pin header support for external 5v supply
