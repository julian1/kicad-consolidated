buy a centre punch - from model shop?

--- 

actually the cap is a problem - because it means we are not sensing current on the
  primary side - if it drops out? - maybe ok with higher relay??

discharge resistor across cap?

larger space for caps
invert regulator diodes which were incorrect
heat dissipation space for ntc 
more space for mov

----i
- have an opto-coupler alternative to short the relay
- use a jumper to select opto or timer.

- mounting holes.
- done - check the timing cap will fit. (it's too close to the pot)
- try to move the NTC resistor to create space

- done - fix transformer footprint
- done - fix terminal block footprint
- done - fix 1m trim pot
- done - pin header support for external 5v supply
