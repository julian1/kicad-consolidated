  - 1mm trace should carry almost 3 amps!
  - 2mm 4 amps 
  - 8mm is between mains and other isolated tracks.
  - ipc recommends 1.27mm clearance for uncoated board, upto 10k feet
  - "We use (UK) 3mm as safety gap for mains to anything else."

use a single voltage divider, and use a pot to adjust the timing.

done - it's around the wrong way - the x2 cap should be near the power connector.

done - high voltage traces should be as short as possible
done - separate netlists for high power and high-voltage

done - we can increase clearence by narrowing the trace

- maybe add genuine gnd plane

- need power connectors - 9.53mm standard, pcb terminal blocks.


what to do with unused lm393 pins. 
what to do with unused relay pins


clearance & creapage distance - 0.25mm is good for 1.25kv but spec requries more.

- setting clearance to 1mm produces too many errors,
- setting to 0.75 and it's only the to92 transistors, that have problems.
