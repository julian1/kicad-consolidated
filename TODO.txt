  - 1mm trace should carry almost 3 amps!
  - 2mm 4 amps 

  - 8mm is between mains and other isolated tracks.

  - ipc recommends 1.27mm clearance for uncoated board, upto 10k feet

  - We use (UK) 3mm as safety gap for mains to anything else.

----
it's around the wrong way - the x2 cap should be near the power connector.

high voltage traces should be as short as possible

we can increase clearence by narrowing the trace 

---
add genuine gnd plane

done - molex connectors

what to do with unused lm393 pins. 
what to do with relay pins

clearance & creapage distance - 0.25mm is good for 1.25kv but spec requries more.

- setting clearance to 1mm produces too many errors,
- setting to 0.75 and it's only the to92 transistors, that have problems.
